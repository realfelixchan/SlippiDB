# SlippiDB
Proof of concept for a simple ETL pipeline, to practice working with AWS. You will need to have access to your own AWS account, and an IAM role with RDS capabilities.

This is going to be a project that will utilize two fanmade packages, slippi-js (Javascript) and py-slippi (Python) to read slp files 
generated by playing SSBM games on the Slippi emulator. The required library not mentioned in the requirements is slippi-js@5.1.1, and also requires node.js.

SlippiToDB will parse through a given directory, process all .slp files within said directory, and output three CSVs. GameData.csv will be used as a means of storing all the data in a singular table, while MatchupResults and StageResults are running totals.
